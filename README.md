*Hello!*

My name is Jo√£o Vitor Amato, I am passionate about technology and always looking to learn and grow professionally.

I am a programmer and graphic designer with skills in Front-End development. I love working in a team and collaborating on interdisciplinary projects, where I can apply my knowledge and skills to achieve amazing results.

When I am not coding or designing, I enjoy to practice any sport or play Valorant. I believe it is important to have balance between work and leisure to maintain motivation and enthusiasm.

I am excited to share my projects and collaborate with the community on GitHub. If you are interested in working together or just want to say hello, do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
